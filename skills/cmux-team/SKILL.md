description: Design the optimal multi-agent cmux team for a coding objective and OUTPUT a ready-to-run /cmux system prompt — the roster (role, model, thinking level, count), topology, coordination protocol, rubric, and constraints. It PLANS the team; it does NOT start the work. Use to staff any non-trivial coding objective before committing tokens; for trivial tasks it recommends a team of one.

# cmux Team — the staffing planner

You DESIGN the team; you do not run it. Given a coding objective, produce ONE
deliverable: a `/cmux` system prompt a human can review, adjust, and launch.
**Never spawn agents or edit code from this skill.** What you PLAN follows the
installed `[[cmux-workspace]]` conventions (worktree isolation, `--focus false`,
additive layout, caller scoping).

## Move 0 · Ground in cmux (latest)
Confirm the `cmux` CLI is available (`cmux version`). Load the vendored
`references/cmux-verbs.snapshot.md` and `references/cmux-docs.snapshot.md` as the
baseline for cmux capabilities. If a verb or flag you need looks stale or absent,
spot-check it against `cmux --help` / `cmux capabilities` before relying on it.
**Never invent cmux syntax** — if it is not in the references or the live CLI,
do not put it in the plan.

## Move 1 · Analyze
Is the objective open-ended? How many genuinely DISTINCT viable approaches exist?
Which subtasks are independent and parallelizable? Which need deep reasoning vs
mechanical execution? If it is trivial → plan a team of ONE and say so. Never
over-staff.

## Move 2 · Pattern
Pick a topology from `references/staffing-heuristics.md`: diverse-build + judge
(default), decompose + assemble, or solo. Add a reviewer/tester when edge cases
or blast radius are high.

## Move 3 · Staff (model · thinking · count)
Assign each role a model, a thinking level, and a headcount using the table in
`references/staffing-heuristics.md`. Right-size — every extra agent is real
tokens. Totals usually land at 3–6, or 1 when trivial.

## Move 4 · Generate the launch kit
Create `.cmux-team/<slug>/` (slug = dash-case of the objective) by substituting
the roster into the templates in `assets/kit-templates/`:
- **`launch.sh`** — the one-line `cmux new-workspace --command 'claude … --append-system-prompt-file .cmux-team/<slug>/lead.md …'` launcher. `__LEAD_MODEL__` = the lead's model from `references/staffing-heuristics.md` (use `opus[1m]` for the opus lead).
- **`lead.md`** — the lead system prompt: fill `__SPAWN_STEPS__` with one spawn block per worker (from `references/orchestration-recipe.md` §1), `__ROSTER_TABLE__`, and the pattern/count. It already embeds the handshake protocol, observability wiring, and rubric.
- **`worker-<role>.md`** — one per teammate from `worker.md`, with `__TASK__`, `__MODEL__`, `__THINKING__`, and the worktree/branch for implementers.
- **`roster.md`** — the human-readable roster + launch instructions.

Substitute EVERY `__TOKEN__`. Use only cmux verbs present in
`references/orchestration-recipe.md` / the live CLI. Tell the operator to add
`.cmux-team/` to their repo's ignore rules; do not edit their `.gitignore` yourself.

## Move 5 · Present the launcher & HALT
Print the roster table and the exact launch line:
`bash .cmux-team/<slug>/launch.sh` (or the inlined `cmux new-workspace …`).
Tell the human: review the kit under `.cmux-team/<slug>/`, adjust models/counts/tasks,
then run the launcher THEMSELVES. **DO NOT run it. Start no work.** The skill's value
is the review gate: planning is cheap, execution is where cost lives.

**Non-disruptive note.** Launching a visible team workspace is the operator's explicit
ask, so `launch.sh` opts into focus for the top-level team workspace. Every worker split
still passes `--focus false` and layout stays additive — never `select-workspace` or
`focus-pane` speculatively (see `[[cmux-workspace]]`).
